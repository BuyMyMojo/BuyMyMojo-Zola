## Twitter's open source replacements of the future

So with the immense amount of talk about yeeting away from twitter because of [ElonMusk](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/25/twitter-accepts-elon-musks-43b-acquisition-offer/) I have finally taken the time to look into some of the other cool alternatives that exist.

A couple cool ones are {{< fa fa="fab fa-mastodon" >}}Mastadon and Pixelfed.

### Mastadon is a direct replacement for Twitter

It has Favourites(Likes) and Boosts(Retweets), Polls, Unlisted and Follower only posts, Built in drawing... for some reason and it even has it's own "tweetdeck"

Mastadon is Open Source and Federated and Decentralised.
A lot of Decentralised things in 2022 use Crypto which really isn't a great experience, Mastodon servers just run on the normal internet without any ties to Crypto or NFTs which means no hexagonal profiles.

Even though it is Decentralised you can access all other communities from whatever instance you sign up on.

## Pixelfed; Instagram but with Twitter's features

Next we have Pixelfed which is more like a mix of Twitter and Instagram with the same concepts as Mastadon, federated, open source and decentralised, But with a focus on Photos and images even providing an option to choose the license you want for your images when you post them.

Pixelfed is a lot less used then Mastadon but it is still a very nice platform if your primary content is images. Both Mastadon and Pixelfed can communicate with each other because they use the same protocol so you can follow Mastadon accounts on Pixelfed and vice versa.

#### The Twitter thread

This post actually stared out as a Twitter thread I made, it is my longest Twitter thread to date and I wrote it over a couple hours while I was looking into these platforms for myself.

<sub>For some reason while converting this post for my website I made major changes to my site; Added AwesomeFont icons, Created 4 custom HUGO short codes, Fixed the social icons in the bottom left, modified how the template embeds links for socials so I can verify that I own this website on Mastodon. I tend to go a little overboard I guess</sub>
